Version 0.2.0
Release Date: 2016-04-24
------------------------------
Changes:
------------------------------
Added ability to upload existing logfiles to dpaste (dpaste.com),
pastebin (pastebin.com), or gist (gist.github.com), provided that the
user of the program has the necessary programs installed (curl,
pastebin, or gist).

Options that require a program not currently installed are not shown on
the menu.

Scripts still individually retain their ability to send to pastebin, in
the event they're invoked as standalone, rather than via the menu.

Changed Files:
mintmenu
