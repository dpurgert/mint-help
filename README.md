# Mint-Help Scripts

These scripts are a variation of the 1-line commands contained in
[Two-Dog's Repo] (https://github.com/two-dogs/the-kennel).  They're
still primarily his (and any other contributor's work).

### OPERATION

Download the script(s) that you want to use, and then either:

1. set them as executable with *chmod o+x <the_script>*, then run them
with *./<the_script>*, OR
2. run them with the command *bash <the_script>.

All of these scripts have commands that require elevated priveleges to
run.  The commands that require it are simply run as "sudo command",
though before execution the script will give you the option to prohibit
the execution of these commands.  However, if you forbid the elevated
privileges, the output of the scripts may not provide those helping you
with the information that they need.
